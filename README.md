Convergent Technologies Miniframe

The Miniframe is a 68010 based machine that ran a version of unix
called "CTIX".  It is a close relation to the ATT Unix PC with many
similarities.  (Both were made by Convergent Technologies.

<p>
I never had CTIX media of any kind (tapes or floppies or hard drive).
I had a couple of boards, one of which I managed to repair, and I did
a lot of reverse engineering.  I also was given a set of detailed manuals
with schematics and programming information.  I worked from these and
developed my own code, but never managed a full unix port.

<p>
I did all this work in 1989 to 1991.  Only now, over 30 years later,
I am putting it up here for some Miniframe enthusiasts to try to
make use of.  At that time I was using a Sun workstation to do my
work, with sun compilers running on a sun3, but also using a
sparstation for some things.

<p>
Here are the projects:

Roms -- boot rom files and disassembly
Monitor -- modified roms with interactive monitor
