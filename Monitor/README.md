Convergent Technologies Miniframe

Monitor project

What you have here is an interactive ROM monitor that I added
to the Miniframe boot roms.  There was enough unused space to
allow this.  The regular boot roms do not talk to the serial
port at all, but this will and allows some interaction.

The files erom.hex and orom.hex should serve to burn a pair
of roms for you (provided you have blank roms and a burner).
